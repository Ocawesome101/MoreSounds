This is a mod for Minecraft Forge 1.18.2 that completely removes the rather arbitrary maximum polyphony limit.  It may work on other versions.

You will need to use your system installation of OpenAL\* (easiest in [PolyMC](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC)) and configure it to have the number of channels you need--I recommend 1024.  On Linux you can do this by running `alsoft-config` in a terminal if the necessary libraries are installed.

\* *There may be a way to configure Minecraft's OpenAL installation.  I am unaware of it.*
